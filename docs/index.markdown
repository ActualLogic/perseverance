## Definition
Continued effort to do or achieve something despite difficulties, failure, or opposition.

## Premise
You may not be able to have everything but you can have anything. 

## Intro
When it comes to perseverance, most people think of that one project where they battened down the hatches and saw it through till completion. Truth is perseverance can lead to much more under the right context. Imagine taking that relentless willpower and channeling it into other aspects of your life? This one small principle can be applied to virtually any area you have goals in to get results you desire. 

Perseverance is a finite resource. While in theory this principle can be applied anywhere, you will only have a limited amount. Carefully choosing where the majority of your limited perseverance will be applied too is extremely important. An entire section will be dedicated to this topic alone.

Case in point, while you might not be a millionaire you can channel the funds you do have to at least one particular aspect. For example, if a car is of the utmost importance to you, well then you can channel the major of you time and money into said car. Obviously, this will detract both time and money from virtually all other areas. However, if a car truly is of the utmost importance to you, then perhaps this configuration makes sense. Again itâ€™s all about deciding where you choose to dedicate the resources you have available to you. Increasing the resources at your disposal, wether it be a vital area such as time or money, is a separate topic. That is not to say that perseverance cannot help you to increase the resources available to you, it is merely suggesting that it more so depends on your strategy, a separate sub-topic.

## Limitations
Perseverance is not be able to be applied to all areas of your life given the amount of focus it requires.

## Choosing what to preserve
Great news! You can choose anything to preserve. Bad news, you only have a limited supply.
